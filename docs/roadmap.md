# Roadmap

This roadmap describes planned areas of work.

It is not a strict release commitment.

## Detection

### YARA memory scanning

YARA memory scanning is planned to improve detection of:

- Packed payloads
- Obfuscated payloads
- Runtime-unpacked malware
- Payloads that are more visible in memory than on disk

This is intended to complement process creation scanning and behavioral detection.

### More Sigma examples

More example Sigma rules are planned for common detection scenarios, including:

- Suspicious PowerShell
- WMI abuse
- Service creation
- Scheduled task creation
- Suspicious Linux process execution
- Suspicious network activity

### Better IOC examples

More IOC examples are planned for:

- Hash matching
- Domain matching
- IP matching
- Path regex matching

## Telemetry

### Expanded Linux eBPF coverage

Linux support currently focuses on process, network, file, and DNS telemetry.

Future work may expand Linux coverage depending on stability, portability, and usefulness.

### Better normalization documentation

More documentation is planned around how raw ETW and eBPF events are normalized into Rustinel’s shared event model.

## Operations

### SIEM integration examples

Rustinel writes ECS NDJSON alerts.

Future documentation should include examples for ingesting those alerts into common SIEM and log platforms.

### Deployment examples

More deployment examples are planned for:

- Windows service mode
- Linux supervisor-based deployment
- Lab environments
- Detection engineering environments

### Hardening guidance

Optional hardening guidance is planned for users who want to make Rustinel harder to stop or identify.

This may include recommendations around:

- Installation paths
- Service names
- File permissions
- Logging locations
- Operational monitoring

## Community

Useful community contributions include:

- Testing on different Windows and Linux versions
- Reporting telemetry gaps
- Improving documentation
- Adding Sigma examples
- Adding YARA examples
- Adding safe demo scenarios
- Testing SIEM ingestion
