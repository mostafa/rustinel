# Rustinel Documentation

Rustinel is a high-performance, user-mode Windows EDR agent written in Rust. It collects
kernel telemetry via ETW, normalizes to Sysmon-style fields, runs Sigma, YARA, and
atomic IOC detection, supports local hot reload of rule/IOC files, and writes ECS 9.3.0
NDJSON alerts (non-ECS fields use the `edr.` prefix).

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

1. Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.
2. Open an elevated PowerShell in the extracted folder.
3. Run `.\rustinel.exe run --console`.
4. Verify output in `logs/rustinel.log.YYYY-MM-DD` and `logs/alerts.json.YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Notes

- Windows only. Administrator privileges are required for ETW.
- Configuration and rules are resolved from the current working directory. For service mode, use absolute paths or environment overrides.
- Service mode is supported on Windows. See the CLI Reference for commands.
- Trusted path allowlisting is shared by default across Response, IOC hash, and YARA (`allowlist.paths`).
- Local hot reload is enabled by default; see Configuration for `reload.*` settings.
