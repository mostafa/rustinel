# Limitations

Rustinel is designed for transparent, rule-based endpoint detection.

Like any detection system, it has boundaries. This page documents them clearly.

## Current limitations

### No commercial EDR-style self-protection

Rustinel does not currently provide the same anti-tamper or self-protection capabilities as mature commercial EDR agents.

A sufficiently privileged attacker may be able to stop, disable, or interfere with user-mode components or telemetry sources.

### No traditional Windows kernel driver

Rustinel uses ETW on Windows rather than a custom Windows kernel driver.

This improves stability and keeps the design simpler, but it also means Rustinel does not have the same visibility or enforcement points as a driver-backed agent.

### Kernel-level threats

Rustinel is not designed today to detect or stop kernel-mode rootkits.

Kernel-level threats, vulnerable driver abuse, and direct telemetry tampering may require additional controls.

### Memory-only payloads

Payloads that exist only in memory can be harder to detect if they do not create useful telemetry or leave a file that can be scanned.

YARA memory scanning is planned to improve coverage against packed, obfuscated, and runtime-unpacked payloads.

### Living-off-the-land activity

Legitimate administrative tools can be abused by attackers.

Rustinel can detect suspicious behavior when matching Sigma rules exist, but heavily obfuscated or context-dependent living-off-the-land activity may still evade detection.

### IOC limitations

IOC matching is deterministic.

It depends on the quality and relevance of the provided indicators.

Hashes, IPs, domains, and path regexes are useful, but they should not be the only detection layer.

### Encrypted C2

Encrypted C2 over trusted or common infrastructure may not be detected by simple IOC matching alone.

Behavioral detection is needed to identify suspicious activity around the network communication.

## How to think about Rustinel

Rustinel should be viewed as a transparent open-source detection engine.

It is useful for:

- Detection engineering
- Endpoint telemetry collection
- Rule testing
- SIEM pipeline testing
- Research
- Lab deployments
- Blue-team experimentation

It should not be presented as a full commercial EDR replacement today.

## Planned improvements

Areas planned for improvement include:

- YARA memory scanning
- Expanded telemetry coverage
- More detection examples
- More deployment hardening options
- Better documentation around operational security and limitations
